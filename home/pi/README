Onyx development image
=========================

This image provides a quick getting-started to Onyx.  This is a Raspian
Jessie Lite image with Onyx pre-installed and configured to operate with:
  * Headphones or speaker plugged into the Pi's headphone jack
  * USB microphone

If you wish audio to go out the HDMI -- e.g. if you have your Pi plugged in
to a TV and you want to use its speaker -- you can edit the auto_run.sh
script and follow the instructions give there.

If you wish to use Wifi instead of an ethernet connection, you can run the
configure_wifi.sh script.  This will start the Onyx wifi setup process.
You only need to do this once, and it begins automatically on boot if no
network is detected.

Onyx will automatically check for updates daily and will also check for
updates on each reboot.
